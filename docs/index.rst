FAQ
===

Q. How is this related to `wireservice/csvkit <https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit>`_?

A. **csvmedkit** is an extension of *csvkit* (and thus has csvkit and `agate <https://github.com/wireservice/agate>`_  as dependencies) that adds a bunch of new command-line utilities for data-wrangling convenience.


Q. What are the point of these new utilities?

A. As useful as core csvkit is, there are still a bunch of common data-wrangling tasks that are cumbersome to perform even when the data is in a spreadsheet or SQL database. "Cumbersome", in the sense that you'd basically have to write a custom Python script to do them.
