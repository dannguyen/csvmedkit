csvflatten

:command:`csvflatten` is a command for producing "flattened" records. Useful for quickly getting a view of records with numerous fields, and for documenting data examples in Markdown-compatible format.

For example, given this ``data.csv``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/flatfruit.csv



â€” :command:`csvflatten` can be used to transform the data into a "narrow" 2-column denormalized format:


.. code-block:: shell

    $ csvflatten data.csv

.. code-block:: text
