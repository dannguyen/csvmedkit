csvmedkit
=========

The unofficial extended family of csvkit, i.e. even more tools for command-line data parsing and wrangling.

Read existing docs as csvmedkit is updated at `csvmedkit.readthedocs.io <https://csvmedkit.readthedocs.io/>`_




**Update 2020-10-02:** This is just csvmedkit with a better, less-stupidly confusing name. And hopefully, a better foundation now that I'm no longer just blindly hacking parts of the original csvkit to get it together. Will be porting (i.e. copy/pasting) csvmedkit's tools and cleaning up the codebase before officially releasing it as "csvmedkit":


- Read TODOS: `TODOS.md <TODOS.md>`_ for an informal roadmap.
- The old, now archived csvkitcat repo: `dannguyen/csvkitcat <https://github.com/dannguyen/csvkitcat>`_
