The unofficial extended family of csvkit, i.e. even more tools for command-line data parsing and wrangling



**Update 2020-10-02:** This is just csvmedkit with a better, less-stupidly confusing name. And hopefully, a better foundation now that I'm no longer just blindly hacking parts of the original csvkit to get it together. Will be porting (i.e. copy/pasting) csvmedkit's tools and cleaning up the codebase before officially releasing it as "csvmedkit":
