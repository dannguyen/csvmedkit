HOWEVER, IN THIS ROLLOVER CRASH THAT OCCURRED, THE REAR WHEEL WITH BRAKE SYSTEM STILL ATTACHED, COMPLETELY SNAPPED OFF THE REAR AXEL.  ALSO, THE INSURANCE COMPANY DID AN ESTIMATE TO REPAIR VEHICLE, BUT DID NOT INCLUDE OR MENTION A REPAIR CHARGE FOR THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL OR THE REAR AXEL.  THE TAIL GATE WAS ALSO RIPPED OFF OF THE TRUCK AND WAS FOUND ABOUT 75 YARDS AWAY FROM THE TOTALED VEHICLE.  NO FATALITIES RESULTED FROM THIS HORRIFIC CRASH, BUT MY SON WHO WAS THE PASSENGER, DID SUFFER SERIOUS AND PERMANENT INJURIES, WHICH INCLUDE A HEAD INJURY (TBI), MULTIPLE FRACTURES TO HIS CTL-SPINE, INJURED RIGHT FOOT, LEG AND HIP, AND ABRASIONS AND DEEP SCRAPES THROUGHOUT HIS BODY.

THE GRILLE GUARD WAS DESIGNED NOT TO BEND OR FLEX WHEN IN USE, AND IN DOING SO MADE THE AIRBAG INOPERABLE (VEHICLE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS INVOLVED IN AN IMPACT) DUE TO ITS HULKING METAL DESIGN. IT ALSO REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE CRUSH SPACE AFFORDED TO ME (I WAS HIT BY A 98 HONDA PASSPORT), CRUSH SPACE AN ELEMENT OF DESIGN ADDED TO REDUCE/ABSORB FORCES AT IMPACT.  WITH THE GRILLE GUARD PRODUCT FIRMLY IN PLACE, IT ELIMINATED THE DESIGNED SAFETY FEATURE OF CRUMPLE ZONES.

THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING IS WITH MICHELIN TIRES (225/50R17).  THREE OF THE FOUR TIRES HAVE DEVELOPED BUBBLES AND HAD TO BE REPLACED WITHIN THE PAST YEAR.  THE FIRST WAS JULY 19, 2009, THE SECOND WAS JULY 2, 2010 AND THE THIRD WAS AUGUST 4, 2010.    I CONTACTED MICHELIN WHO GAVE ME THE RUN-AROUND BUT NO SOLUTION.  I TOOK THE LAST TIRE TO A MICHELIN DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT MICHELIN WOULDN'T GIVE ME ANYTHING BECAUSE AN AUTHORIZED DEALER DIDN'T REPLACE THE TIRE.  HOW CAN I GO AROUND FINDING A PARTICULAR DEALER WHEN I'M SETTING ON THE INTERSTATE WITH A FLAT TIRE?  I WENT TO THE FIRST PLACE I FOUND WHO COULD REPLACE THE TIRE.  EACH TIME I WAS OUT OF TOWN WHEN THE FAILURE HAPPENED, THE FIRST TWO TIMES I WAS EVER OUT OF STATE SO IT'S NOT LIKE BEING AT HOME WHERE YOU CAN LOOK IN THE YELLOW PAGES OR SURF THE NET AND FIND AN AUTHORIZED DEALER.  THE AUTHORIZED DEALER THAT I CONTACTED AFTER THE 3RD FAILURE SAID IT WAS DUE TO IMPACT FROM POTHOLES.  DUH!  IT'S SUMMERTIME.  POTHOLES HAVE BEEN REPAIRED.  I FEEL THAT MICHELIN (AND REPRESENTATIVES) HAVE FAILED ME AS A CONSUMER.  THEY CLAIM TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO - STAND BEHIND BECAUSE THEY SURE DON'T STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND HANDLE THE PROBLEM.  I FEEL THAT I HAD 4 DEFECTIVE TIRES EITHER MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT OR DRY ROT OR SOMETHING.  I HAVE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF DRIVING (40+ YRS) HAVE I REPLACED A TIRE FOR A BUBBLE IN IT AND NOW 3 IN LESS THAN A YEAR?????  NO MORE MICHELIN FOR ME. *TR	IVOQ	N		N	N	N						72														V

THIS STARTED HAPPENING AFTER A MONTH WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CAR FROM LANG AUTOS IN LYNNWOOD, WASHINGTON. FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WHEN I HAD TO STOP ABRUPTLY AND THERE WAS GRAVEL ON THE ROAD WHICH ENGAGED ABS. AS SOON AS ABS WAS ENGAGED BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND MY CAR HARDLY STOPPED CAUSING ME TO RUN A RED LIGHT. I WAS ALMOST ABOUT TO RUN INTO A PEDESTRIAN.   THIS IS A PERMANENT ISSUE AND I HAVE HAD ROTORS BRAKE PADS CALIPERS CHECKED. I HAVE ALSO HAD THE BRAKES BLED AND TESTED FOR ANY LEAKS. IT CAME OUT NEGATIVE. MASTER CYLINDER WORKS FINE AND THERE IS NO LEAKS IN BRAKE LINE. NO LEAKS IN ANY JOINTS THAT CONNECTS TO MASTER CYLINDER AND ABS MODULE. I HAVE HAD MY CAR TESTED AND SEEMS LIKE THE ISSUE COMES FROM ABS MODULE/CONTROLLER THAT MIGHT NEED A REPLACEMENT. IT  IS A VERY COSTLY PART PLUS LABOR COSTS ARE HUGE. ON TOP OF THAT I HAVE ALREADY SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN DIAGNOSING CAUSE AND REPLACING PARTS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO ACTUAL COST.   	IVOQ	N		N	N	N						30														V		N	N

SHE HEARD A LOUD POPPING NOISE AND SUDDENLY THE WHEELS JERKED TO THE LEFT, SENDING HER INTO A PARKED CAR.  THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL WAS SUBSEQUENTLY UNRESPONSIVE TO STEERING.  UPON EVALUATION BY A MECHANIC, THE FRONT LEFT SPINDLE HAD SNAPPED AND ALSO IN THE PROCESS HAD BROKEN THE LEFT SIDE TIE ROD.  THE PARTS WERE REPLACED.  THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING FILED BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN NO UNDUE STRESS ON THE SPINDLE; IT JUST FAILED OUTRIGHT WITH NO WARNING.
