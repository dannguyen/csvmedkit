        INVESTIGATOR KAEHLER RECEIVED A COMPLAINT ALLEGING CLOUDS OF DUST ARE BEING EMITTED BY ARROW TERMINAL.  UPON ARRIVAL, I OBSERVED A FRONT END LOADER / OPERATOR SCREENING PIG IRON ORE CAUSING A RUST LIKE DUST PARTICULATE CLOUD TO BE EMITTED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.  
        I SPOKE AND TOURED THE SITE WITH STEVE CAUDLE, TERMINAL MANGER FOR ARROW TERMINAL.  I HAD STEVE IMMEDIATELY STOP OPERATOR FROM SCREENING UNTIL THE SITE'S WATER TRUCK REFILLS & BEGINS MISTING THE PILE.  ARROW IS A BARGE AND TRUCKING TERMINAL.  THEY RECEIVE FERROUS AND ALLOY METALS.  METALS ARE STORED AND PROCESSED THROUGH CRUSHING AND SCREENING OPERATIONS.  SITE HAS A CURRENT CERTIFICATE OF OPERATIONS # 082281 AND A CURRENT LIMITED BUSINESS LICENSE # 80721.  SITE ALSO HAS A DOT REGISTRATION #031600FDC FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.
        STEVE INFORMED ME ARROW HAS SENT PACKET OF INFORMATION TO DOE INSPECTOR RAFAEL MACIAL REGARDING WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING TO MINIMIZE ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION.  CURRENTLY, THEY ARE LOOKING INTO 2 DIFFERENT METHODS / TECHNOLOGIES, A FOAMING AGENT & MISTING SYSTEM TO BE INSTALLED FOR THE PIG IRON OPERATIONS.

SITE CONDITIONS:

1.        SITE HAS NUMEROUS STOCK PILES OF PIG IRON STORED ON THE OUTSIDE.  THIS MATERIAL IS ACCESSIBLE TO THE WEATHER AND CAN CAUSE DUST EMISSIONS FROM LOADING THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL INTO TRUCKS.  I REQUESTED STEVE TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO MINIMIZE DUST EMISSIONS FROM THE LOADING OPERATIONS OF MATERIAL CONTAINING FINE PARTICLES OF DUST ( SEE PHOTOS #1 & #2 ).

2.        WE PROCEEDED TO INSPECT THE NUMEROUS BUILDINGS USED FOR STORAGE OF METALS.  SOME OF THE METALS STORED INSIDE OF BUILDINGS HAVE FINE DUST PARTICLES THAT CAN BECOME WINDBORNE DURING LOADING OPERATIONS.  I ASKED STEVE HOW ARE THESE TYPES OF MATERIALS ARE LOADED OUT?  STEVE STATED THESE MATERIALS ARE LOADED INTO TRUCKS BY A FRONT END LOADER.  DOORS ARE USUALLY OPEN DURING LOADING OPERATIONS.  I REQUESTED HE KEEP DOORS CLOSED DURING THESE OPERATIONS.

3.        THE SITE'S ROADWAYS ARE MAINLY PAVED WITH ASPHALT OR CONCRETE.  SOME OF THE ROADWAYS ARE PAVED WITH SLAG.  THESE ROADWAYS HAVE AN ACCUMULATION OF DEBRIS SUSCEPTIBLE OF BECOMING WINDBORNE.  STEVE INFORMED THE SITE HAS A STREET SWEEPER AND A OLD FIRE TRUCK USED TO MAINTAIN THE ROADWAYS AND A CHEMICAL SUPPRESSION AGENT IS USED ON THE ROADWAYS TO MINIMIZE ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION.

        STEVE INFORMED ME THE DISTRICT MANAGERS FOR ARROW TERMINAL ARE DISCUSSING SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE SITE RANGING FROM DEMOLITION OF OLD BUILDINGS AND DUST COLLECTION SYSTEMS FOR CRUSHING & SCREENING OPERATIONS.  I SPOKE WITH COMPLAINANT WHOM INFORMED ME HE OBSERVED CLOUDS OF DUST BEING EMITTED FROM A FRONT END LOADER LOADING PIG IRON INTO A TRUCK.  I REQUESTED STEVE TO IMPLEMENT A SOP FOR THE PIG IRON SCRAP & FORWARD THAT TO DOE AND RECOMMENDED ARROW IMPLEMENT A DUST PLAN FOR ROADWAYS, LOADING & UNLOADING OPERATIONS.
